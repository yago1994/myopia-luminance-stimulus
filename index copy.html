                To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him
                mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
                predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
                akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,
                were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He
                was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
                the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
                false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
                and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for
                drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained
                reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
                adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
                throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
                instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
                be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
                yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
                Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
